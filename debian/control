Description: Experimental high-performance SWF (Adobe Flash) player
 Lightspark is a free Flash player for Linux which aims for high-performance
 by using modern technologies such as JIT compilation and OpenGL shaders.
 .
 The project is currently very experimental, we provide the standalone
 player for testing purposes only.
 .
 Nice features:
 * JIT compilation of ActionScript to native x86 bytecode
 * Hardware accelerated rendering using OpenGL shaders (GLSL)
 * Aims to support current-generation ActionScript 3
 * A new, clean, codebase exploiting multithreading and optimized for modern
   hardware. Designed from scratch after the official Flash documentation was
   released.
