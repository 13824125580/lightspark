Lightspark third Technical demo README

First of all I'd like to thank you for testing the lightspark project,
the current status is kind of stable, although not ready for end users

Be aware that the following feature are not yet supported or stable enough to be include in the demo

-) Sound support
-) Input support
-) Antialiasing

This demo already includes a lot of cool features

-) GLSL based rendering of fill styles (eg. gradients)
-) LLVM based ActionScript execution. Code is compiled just in time
-) A few tricks are also played to decrease the stack traffic tipical of stack machines.
-) First, although simple, framerate timing
-) Framework to handle ActionScript asynchronous events.


INSTALLATION:
To compile this software you need to install development packages for llvm-2.6, sdl, opengl and curl
To build the software please follow those steps.

1) cd lightspark
2) make release

EXECUTION:
This demo aims at rendering, at least partially, the runtime generated UI of the new YouTube player. Recently YouTube switched 
to Flash 10 and AS3 to serve some HD content, while maintaining the old AS2 based player for lower quality content.

Currently only the standalone player is supported.

-) First of all download the YouTube player SWF file.
	wget http://s.ytimg.com/yt/swf/watch_as3-vfl143390.swf
-) The player works by gathering the parameters from the Javascript in the page. Lightspark support loading parameters from a text file
   using the --parameters-file command line. The release includes a suitable yt-args file
-) Execute the file, this will render the usual UI of the YouTube player. Do not expect the video to actally play, as video downloading
   and decoding is not yet supported
	./lightspark --parameters-file yt-args watch_as3-vfl143390.swf
