Lightspark Technical demo README

First of all I'd like to thank you for testing the lightspatk project,
the current status is really primitive, but I'd like to show that something
already works.

This demo should be able to render correctly the flash test page at
http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/

Be aware that the following feature are not yet supported or stable enough to be include in the demo

-) Sound support
-) Input support
-) Antialiasing

To build the software please follow those steps

1) cd plugin/
2) make
3) make install

The installation copy the plugin to $HOME/.mozilla/plugins/lightspark.so

Now from firefox add-on configuration disable any other flash compatible plugins such as the adobe player or gnash

Open http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/

You're warmly invited to send feedback and error report on the project mailing list (lighspark-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
or bug trakcer on sourceforge
