Lightspark second Technical demo README

First of all I'd like to thank you for testing the lightspark project,
the current status is quite primitive, but I'd like to showcase the technology of this project

Be aware that the following feature are not yet supported or stable enough to be include in the demo

-) Sound support
-) Input support
-) Antialiasing

This demo already includes a lot of cool features

-) GLSL based rendering of fill styles (eg. gradients)
-) LLVM based ActionScript execution. Code is compiled just in time
-) A few tricks are also played to decrease the stack traffic tipical of stack machines.
-) First, although simple, framerate timing
-) Framework to handle ActionScript asynchronous events.


INSTALLATION:
To compile this software you need to install development packages for llvm-2.6, sdl and opengl.
To build the software please follow those steps.

1) cd lightspark
2) make

EXECUTION:
This demo aims at rendering a simple SWF file generated from the mxml source test2.mxml in this directory.
You can generate test2.swf to test2.mxml using the mxmlc compiler included in the flex sdk. For your
convenience you can download the compiled demo from

http://allievi.sssup.it/tatiana/test2.swf

You can execute the file using the standalone player

./lightspark test2.swf

Be aware that this will generate a massive amount of debugging messages. Press 'Q' on Lightspark window to
close the application
